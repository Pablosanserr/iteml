# iteml
ITEML (Intuitive Touchscreen Embedded Menu Library) is a C library that provides easy and intuitive creation of menus on a microcontroller touch screen. ITEML uses [LVGL](https://lvgl.io) underneath. LVGL is used to create UIs, and ITEML uses it to create menus in a simple way. With ITEML, the user does not need to have a deep knowledge of LVGL.

`iteml.h` contains the functions that the user must call for creating the different menus.
